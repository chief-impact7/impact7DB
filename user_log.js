사용자: Act as a Frontend UI/UX Expert strictly following Google Material Design 3 guidelines.
Please create the initial UI files (index.html, style.css, and app.js) for our Academy Management Dashboard.

Design Requirements:

Style: Minimalist, clean, ample whitespace, and rounded corners (similar to Google Workspace apps like Google Calendar or Gmail).

Assets: Use Google Fonts (e.g., Roboto or Google Sans) and Material Symbols via CDN. Do NOT use complex external UI frameworks, keep it lightweight with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.

Layout Requirements:

Top App Bar: Title "Academy Flow Dashboard" on the left, and a "Login with Google" button on the right.

Left Panel (Sidebar, ~30% width): A search input field for finding students, followed by a scrollable list of mock student cards (e.g., "Student A - Grade 3", "Student B - Grade 5").

Main Panel (~70% width): A "Daily Flow Check" detail view for the selected student. It should include:

Student Name and Branch header.

"Check-in Time" and "Check-out Time" input fields or buttons.

A checklist section for "Daily Routine Tasks" (e.g., Vocabulary Test, Math Review).

A prominent Material Design "Save Changes" button at the bottom.

Logic Requirements (app.js):
Do NOT implement actual Firebase connections yet. Just create the UI structure and add empty placeholder functions (e.g., function handleLogin() { console.log("Login clicked"); }, function saveDailyFlow() {}) in app.js so another AI can wire up the backend logic later.

작업: Google Material Design 3 가이드라인에 맞춰 Academy Management Dashboard의 기본 UI 구조(index.html, style.css, app.js)를 생성함. 외부 라이브러리 없이 Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS로 구현하였으며, 추후 Firebase 연동을 위한 빈 placeholder 함수들을 app.js에 추가함.
